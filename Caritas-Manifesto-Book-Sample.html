    <h1 class="page-header">WELCOME</h1>

    <p class="content-text">Dear Friend,</p>

    <p class="content-text">
      If you're holding this book, chances are you're asking a question—maybe one you've been asking for a while now:
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p class="highlight-text">"Now that I'm saved, then what?"</p>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text">It's a good question. An honest question. And it's the question this book exists to answer.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Maybe you're a new believer, fresh from that moment of salvation, wondering what the Christian life is supposed to look like going forward.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Maybe you've been a Christian for years but feel stuck—going through the motions, checking the boxes, wondering if there's more to this than what you're currently experiencing.</p>
    <p class="content-text">Maybe you're exhausted from trying to be a "good Christian"—serving, performing, keeping up appearances—but feeling empty inside.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p class="highlight-text">Wherever you are, this book is for you.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text">
      Because here's the truth: Salvation isn't the end of the story. <strong>It's the beginning.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">
      God didn't save you just to forgive you. He saved you to transform you, to fill you, to give you a life so abundant that it overflows into everything you touch.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">Jesus said it plainly: <em>"I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full"</em> (John 10:10).</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p class="highlight-text">Full life. Abundant life. Overflowing life.<br> Not someday in heaven. Starting now.</p>
    </div>

    <span class="page-number">i</span>
  </div>

  <!-- Welcome Page 2 -->
  <div class="page">
    <p class="content-text">
      But here's what most of us miss: Abundant life doesn't come from trying harder, doing more, or performing better. It comes from one thing—<strong>loving God with everything you've got.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">When Jesus was asked to identify the most important commandment, He didn't hesitate:</p>

    <div class="scripture-box">
      <p class="scripture-text">
        "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." — Mark 12:30
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text">Notice He didn't say "some of your heart" or "most of your strength." He said <strong>all.</strong></p>
    <p class="content-text">
      God isn't interested in being one priority among many. He's not content with Sundays while the rest of your week belongs to other loves. <strong>He wants everything.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">And when you give Him everything, <strong>you get everything in return—Him.</strong></p>
    <p class="content-text">
      That's what this 40-day journey is about: discovering what it means to love God with everything you've got, and experiencing the abundant life that flows from that love.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">Not through guilt. Not through performance. But through encounter, transformation, and walking in step with the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p class="highlight-text">This isn't another self-help book. This is an invitation into the life you were made for.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="content-text">
      Over the next 40 days, we're going to walk together. I'll be honest with you about my struggles and questions. I'll share what I've learned—not because I've arrived, but because I'm on the journey too.
    </p>
    <p class="content-text">And we'll discover together what Jesus meant when He promised life to the full.</p>
    <p class="content-text">So welcome. I'm honored you're here.</p>

      <strong>This Is a Journey, Not a Sprint</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="content-text">
      Over the next 40 days, you're going to explore what it means to love God with everything you've got. That's not something you can rush. It requires time, reflection, honesty, and the Holy Spirit's work in your heart.
    </p>

    <p class="content-text"><strong>Here's how to get the most from this journey:</strong></p>

    <div class="numbered-section">
      <p class="section-number">1.</p>
      <p class="section-title">COMMIT TO THE FULL 40 DAYS</p>
      <p class="content-text">This isn't a book you skim or read in one sitting. It's designed to be taken <strong>one day at a time, for 40 days.</strong></p>
      <p class="content-text">Why 40 days?</p>
      <p class="content-text">Because the Bible shows us that <strong>40 is the number of transformation:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Noah's world was transformed by 40 days of rain</li>
        <li>Moses was transformed by 40 days on Mount Sinai</li>
        <li>The Israelites were tested for 40 years in the wilderness</li>
        <li>Jesus was empowered by 40 days in the desert</li>
        <li>The disciples were transformed by 40 days with the risen Christ</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content-text"><strong>Transformation doesn't happen overnight. It happens through consistent, daily encounters with God.</strong></p>
      <p class="content-text">So don't rush. Commit to the full journey.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-section">
      <p class="section-number">2.</p>
      <p class="section-title">READ EVERY DAY</p>
      <p class="content-text">Set aside <strong>15-20 minutes each day</strong> to read that day's chapter and reflect on it.</p>
      <p class="content-text"><strong>Pick a consistent time:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Early morning before the day starts?</li>
        <li>During lunch break?</li>
        <li>Before bed?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content-text">It doesn't matter when—just be consistent. Consistency creates momentum, and momentum creates transformation.</p>
      <p class="content-text"><strong>Don't try to read ahead.</strong> Each day builds on the previous one. Trust the process.</p>

    <div class="main-content">
      <p>Now that you're saved, then what?</p>
      <p>It's the question every believer asks—usually around Day 2 of the Christian life. You prayed the prayer. You meant it. You're forgiven, adopted, sealed by the Holy Spirit. Heaven is secured.</p>
      <p>But now it's Monday morning. And you're wondering: <strong>What does the Christian life actually look like?</strong></p>

      <h3>The Greatest Commandment</h3>
      <p>When a religious expert asked Jesus to identify the most important commandment, Jesus didn't hesitate:
        <em>"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength"</em> (Mark 12:30).
      </p>
      <p>Notice what He didn't say. He didn't say, "Go to church regularly." He didn't say, "Read your Bible daily." He didn't say, "Serve in ministry." Those things matter, but they're not the core.</p>
      <p><strong>The core is love—wholehearted, all-consuming, nothing-held-back love for God.</strong></p>
      <p>This isn't a suggestion. It's not advice for the spiritually elite. It's the answer to the question: <strong>What does God want from me?</strong></p>
      <p>He wants your heart.</p>
    </div>

    <span class="page-number">1</span>
  </div>

  <!-- Day 1 Page 2 -->
  <div class="page">
    <div class="main-content">
      <h3>The All-Consuming Nature</h3>
      <p>Look at those words again: <strong>all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, all your strength.</strong></p>
      <p>Not some. Not most. <strong>All.</strong></p>
      <p>God isn't interested in partial devotion. He's not content being one priority among many. He's not satisfied with Sundays while the rest of your week belongs to other loves.</p>
      <p>The Apostle Paul put it bluntly: <em>"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain"</em> (Philippians 1:21). Christ wasn't part of Paul's life—<strong>Christ was his life.</strong></p>
      <p>That's what loving God with everything looks like.</p>

      <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>You might be thinking, "That sounds exhausting. Intense. Unrealistic."</p>
      <p>But here's what most people miss: <strong>This commandment isn't a burden—it's liberation.</strong></p>
      <p>You were designed to love God with everything. When you do, you're living according to your deepest design. When you don't, you're constantly fighting against how you were made.</p>
      <p>Jesus said it this way: <em>"I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full"</em> (John 10:10). Full life—<strong>abundant life</strong>—doesn't come from holding back from God. It comes from giving Him everything.</p>

      <h3>The Gap We All Feel</h3>
      <p>If you're honest, there's probably a gap between what you just read and what you're currently experiencing.</p>
      <p>You know you should love God with everything. But you're not sure you do. You're not sure you even know how.</p>
      <p><strong>That's okay. That's why you're here.</strong></p>
      <p>This 40-day journey exists to close that gap—to move you from knowing you should love God with everything to actually doing it.</p>
      <p>Not through guilt. Not through performance. But through encounter, transformation, and the power of the Holy Spirit working in you.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- Day 1 Page 3 -->
  <div class="page">
    <div class="main-content">
      <h3>The Invitation</h3>
      <p>Here's what the next 40 days will do:</p>
      <p><strong>Days 1-7:</strong> We'll establish the foundation—why loving God with everything is the only response that makes sense.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 8-17:</strong> We'll lay the groundwork—exclusive devotion, purpose beyond pardon, substance over sentiment.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 18-29:</strong> We'll pursue transformation—reorienting your life, renewing your mind, nourishing your soul, embracing your new identity.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 30-37:</strong> We'll explore relationships—abiding in Christ, growing in community, representing Him in the world.</p>
      <p><strong>Days 38-40:</strong> We'll integrate everything—moving from performance to presence and learning to love God back.</p>
      <p><strong>This is the roadmap. This is the answer to "Now that I'm saved, then what?"</strong></p>

      <h3>Closing</h3>
      <p>Loving God with everything isn't something you manufacture through willpower. It's something you discover through encounter, cultivate through practice, and sustain through the Spirit's power.</p>
      <p>Over the next 40 days, you're going to learn what that looks like.</p>
      <p>It starts with a question: <strong>What does God want from me?</strong></p>
      <p>And it leads to an answer: <strong>Everything. And in return, He gives you Himself—which is everything.</strong></p>

        Father, I'm starting this journey with honesty: I don't know if I love You with everything. I want to, but I'm not sure I know how. Over these 40 days, teach me. Show me what wholehearted devotion looks like. Transform my love from obligation to delight. In Jesus' name, Amen.

      <p>Most Christians can tell you what they were saved from: sin, hell, judgment, death, separation from God.</p>
      <p>But ask them what they were saved FOR, and the answers get vague.</p>
      <p>"To go to heaven when I die?" "To be a good person?" "To serve God?"</p>
      <p>Those aren't wrong, but they're incomplete. And that incompleteness leaves millions of believers wondering: <strong>Now that I'm saved, what am I supposed to do with this salvation?</strong></p>

      <h3>The Exodus Pattern</h3>
      <p>God didn't just rescue Israel FROM Egypt—He rescued them TO the Promised Land.</p>
      <p>Liberation wasn't the end goal. It was the beginning.</p>
      <p>The same is true for you. Salvation isn't just escape—<strong>it's entrance.</strong> Entrance into relationship, purpose, calling, abundant life.</p>

      <p>Paul makes this explicit in Ephesians 2. First, he establishes salvation by grace:
        <em>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast"</em> (Ephesians 2:8-9).
      </p>

      <p>But he doesn't stop there. Verse 10: <em>"For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."</em></p>
      <p>You weren't just saved by grace. <strong>You were saved for works.</strong> Not works that earn salvation, but works that express it.</p>

      <h3>Purpose Beyond Pardon</h3>
      <p>If salvation is only about forgiveness, then the best thing that could happen after you're saved is for you to die immediately. Heaven secured, no risk of sinning again. Problem solved.</p>
      <p>But God doesn't operate that way. He saves you, then leaves you on earth. Why?</p>
      <p><strong>Because salvation has purpose beyond pardon.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus said it plainly: <em>"I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full"</em> (John 10:10). Full life—<em>perissos</em> in Greek—means overflowing, abundant, more than enough.</p>
      <p>Not just survival. <strong>Thriving.</strong></p>
      <p>Salvation isn't fire insurance. It's not just "you get to go to heaven when you die." It's <strong>abundant life starting now.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Works Prepared for You</h3>
      <p>Notice what Ephesians 2:10 says: God prepared good works <strong>in advance</strong> for you to do.</p>
      <p>Before you were born, God had a plan. Before you knew His name, He knew yours. And woven into your design—your personality, your gifts, your experiences, your passions—are works He prepared specifically for you.</p>
      <p>Your calling isn't random. It's <strong>custom-designed.</strong></p>
      <p>This is why you can't find ultimate satisfaction doing someone else's calling. You can only flourish when you're walking in what God prepared for you.</p>

      <h3>What You're Saved For</h3>
      <p>So what ARE you saved for?</p>
      <p>Here's the simple answer: <strong>You're saved to love God with everything and live from the overflow of that love.</strong></p>
      <p>That's it. That's the core.</p>
      <p>Everything else flows from that. When you love God with everything:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Worship becomes delight, not duty</li>
        <li>Service flows from overflow, not obligation</li>
        <li>Relationships reflect Christ's love</li>
        <li>Work becomes kingdom-building, not just paycheck-earning</li>
        <li>Suffering has meaning</li>
        <li>Joy isn't dependent on circumstances</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>This is what you were saved for.</strong></p>

      <h3>The Shift Required</h3>
      <p>Most Christians live focused on what they were saved FROM. That creates a defensive, survival-mode Christianity.</p>
      <p>But when you understand what you were saved FOR, everything shifts. You move from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Escaping hell → Pursuing intimacy</li>
        <li>Avoiding sin → Embracing purpose</li>
        <li>Surviving → Thriving</li>
        <li>Minimum viable Christianity → Abundant life</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The question isn't just "Am I saved?" The question is "Am I living like I'm saved FOR something?"</p>

      <h3>Closing</h3>
      <p>Over the next 38 days, we're going to explore what it means to live saved FOR something—to love God with everything and experience the abundant life Jesus promised.</p>
      <p>Today, just let this sink in: <strong>You weren't just rescued from something. You were rescued for something.</strong></p>
      <p>And that something is worth everything.</p>

      <p class="prayer-text">
        Father, thank You for saving me. Not just FROM sin, but FOR purpose. Help me see my salvation not as an escape plan but as an entrance into abundant life. Show me what You prepared for me to do. And help me live from that overflow. In Jesus' name, Amen.
